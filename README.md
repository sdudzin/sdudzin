# Hi, I'm Siarhei 👋

**Software Engineer** | Scala, Java, Akka/Pekko, Kafka | Event-Driven Systems | AI

I build and transform high-load, event-driven platforms-and contribute the solutions back to open source.

## What I Do

Over 20+ years, I've worked on systems that handle millions of transactions, migrated legacy platforms to modern architectures, and introduced ML-based automation. I thrive in collaborative teams of senior engineers solving hard problems at scale.

I don't just design systems-I build them.
